# goqtuic

This fork of `stephenlyu/goqtuic` is created in case the repository or its dependent packages like `jteeuwen/go-pkg-xmlx` become unavailable from Github. (for getting removed or something...)

Also I put `godependency/go-pkg-xmlx` for a replacement of the actually deleted `jteeuwen/go-pkg-xmlx`.

`godependency/go-pkg-xmlx` is just another hosting of `mattn/go-pkg-xmlx` which is an alternative for `jteeuwen/go-pkg-xmlx`.

I made `stephenlyu/goqtuic` and its dependencies owned by myself to nail them down.

(For those of seeming-unreliable sources, like, when there are only a few people that manages the repository.)
